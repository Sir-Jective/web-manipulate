# Manipulate with a service worker
You have to make sw_hij.js available (using e.g. an addon) on the website you want to manipulate.

You insert the content of swm_hij_inserter.js on the browser console or make swm_hij.html available

Click Install SW

Then you can manipulate any GET request the site makes.

##Downsides:
Only works when website is served with https

You need to make a script available with **other** means.
